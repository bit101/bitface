Garmin Watch Face

This is a very simple watch face I made for my Garmin Forerunner 255. Made for my own education and because I wanted a highly visible watch face with time, date, steps and heart rate and not much else.

This will probably work on most Garmin watches, but sizes may need to be adjusted.

Build requirements:

## Garmin ConnectIQ

https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/

This is the SDK, tool kit and simulator used to compile the face.

## FontBM

Needed to create the bitmap font from a ttf. FontBM is a Linux tool which is compatible with BMFont, a Windows tool that is usually used for this purpose.
